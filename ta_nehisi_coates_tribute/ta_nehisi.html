                <p class="titles">Early years</p>
                <p class="bio-text">Coates was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father, William Paul "Paul" Coates, was a Vietnam War veteran, former Black Panther, publisher and librarian. His mother, Cheryl Lynn <em>(Nee Waters)</em>, was a teacher. Coates' father founded and ran Black Classic Press, a publisher specializing in African-American titles.
                    <br>
                    <br> Growing up in Baltimore during the crack epidemic, within the household he said that the important overarching focus was on rearing children with values based on family, respect for elders and being a contribution to your community.
                    <br>
                    <br> Coates' interest in books was instilled at an early age when his mother, in response to bad behavior, would require him to write essays. Coates attended a number of Baltimore-area schools, before graduating from Woodlawn High School. After high school, Coates attended Howard University. He left after five years to start a career in journalism. He is the only child in his family without a college degree.</p>

                <p class="bio-text">
                    Coates' first journalism job was as a reporter at The Washington City Paper. From 2000 to 2007, Coates worked as a journalist at various publications, including Philadelphia Weekly, The Village Voice and Time. His first article for The Atlantic, "This Is How We Lost to the White Man", about Bill Cosby and conservatism, led to an appointment with a regular column for The Atlantic. Coates became a senior editor at The Atlantic, for which he wrote feature articles as well as maintaining his blog. Topics covered by the blog included politics, history, race, culture as well as sports, and music, leading to a place on the Best Blogs of 2011 list by Time magazine and the 2012 Hillman Prize for Opinion &amp; Analysis Journalism from The Sidney Hillman Foundation. Coates is a national correspondent at The Atlantic.

                <p class="titles">Books</p>
                <p class="bio-text">In 2008 Coates published a memoir entitled The Beautiful Struggle. He started off writing for small alternative publications and then began writing for Slate and The Atlantic. His Atlantic essay “The Case for Reparations” (2014) attracted a copious amount of attention and debate. He is now a senior editor at the magazine. He has won the Kirkus Prize and a MacArthur Fellowship. Between the World and Me won the 2015 National Book Award. A lifelong comic book fan, he just published The Black Panther (2016) for Marvel. From 2012-2014 he was the MLK Visiting Professor at MIT, and was a journalist-in-residence at the City University of New York in 2014. He is married to Kenyatta Matthews and has one son, Samori.</p>
